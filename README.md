# Dataset-Translator-App
The Dataset Language Translator is a Python application that converts the content of a dataset from one language to another. It allows users to upload .csv or .xlsx files, select a target language from a dropdown menu, and translates the text within the dataset using Google Translate. The translated dataset is saved as a new Excel file.
